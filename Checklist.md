No philosophy. No fluff. Just guardrails.

Anchor Asset — 1-Page Checklist
Purpose

Build useful, durable assets without burnout, polish traps, or identity attachment.

1. Problem Gate (Must Pass All)

☐ I personally experience this problem
☐ It happens more than once
☐ Existing solutions annoy me
☐ It can exist without my attention
☐ It still matters if I disappear for months

If any are false → stop.

2. Shape Gate (Non-Negotiable)

☐ Tool / script / utility (not a service)
☐ Local-first or low-touch
☐ Complete when it works
☐ Usable without hand-holding
☐ Safe to abandon

If it requires:

community

narrative

constant care
→ reject.

3. Build Phase (Selfish by Design)

☐ Solve only my problem
☐ No roadmap
☐ No audience thinking
☐ No branding
☐ No polish goals

Stop when:
“This removes the frustration from my life.”

4. Stabilize (Short + Finite)

☐ Sensible defaults
☐ Clear failure modes
☐ Repeatable usage
☐ Minimal README

No:

expansion

elegance

optimization

Boredom = stop signal.

5. Integrity Pass (Exactly One)

Answer once:

☐ Nothing sloppy
☐ Nothing misleading
☐ A competent peer wouldn’t be embarrassed using this

If all true → freeze.

No second pass.

6. Release Rule (Detach)

☐ Project no longer represents me
☐ Infrastructure, not identity
☐ Silence = success
☐ Touch only if I need it

I am allowed to walk away.

7. Monetization (Optional)

Allowed only if it does not change shape.

☐ One-time purchase
☐ Simple checkout
☐ Minimal description

No funnels. No growth games.
Money is a side effect.

8. Success Test (Binary)

☐ It works
☐ It stands alone
☐ I feel no obligation to it

If yes → success.

9. Long-Term Rule

☐ One asset at a time
☐ Finish completely
☐ Let it run
☐ Stack outcomes, not effort

10. Final Stop Signal

If it works and I’m still polishing,
I’m protecting identity — not improving value.

Stop.
