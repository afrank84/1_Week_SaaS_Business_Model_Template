## The Feasibility Test
### What is the Idea?

### What are the minimal features needed to sell it?

### What are all the features you would like to add to it? (Feature creep)

### What are all of the dependencies to get this product selling?
(Example: Website, Paypal Account, GitHub Pipeline)

### Can this be built in a week?

### Any divisions of responsibility?
(Example: Jim will do..., Bill will do...)

## The Smell Test
### Can I see this to ten people in a month?

### Is the business scaleable?

### Can you walk away from the business and it still make money passively?

## The Plan
### The Build Stage
(All items come from dependencies)

### The Test\Market Phase
(Break stuff fix stuff, get feed back)

### The Sell Stage
(Launch product, screw what everyone thinks)

### The Upsale Feature Creep
(Give people what they want within reason, break into quartly promises)
